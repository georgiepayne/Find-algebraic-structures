# Find-algebraic-structures

This Python script searches for commutative finite division rings of specified sizes by generating addition and multiplication tables and validating them against algebraic properties (commutativity, associativity, identity, inverses, and distributivity). It outputs all valid ring structures for the given size. For a more detailed description of the project, see the pdf document titled find-cfdr-report.pdf.
